### A lightbox task using vanilla js and google custom search engine :sparkles: :tada:

##### Thoughts on various photo APIs:

- _Instagram_ : oAuth 2 is awesome, but going through authentication trouble when you just wanna dig into the actual code I did not find was worth it.  
- _Google Custom Search_ : has a limited number of requests per day which interfers quite a bit with the development process. Also documentation for this particular product(especially if comparing to Google Maps per se) is lacking.
